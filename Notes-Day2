List

   it is collecton of objects
   It is a linear collection of objects
   it is a mutable collection ( the object is manipulatable)
   it supports random access(random deletion, insertion and read)
   We use indexing to access the elements
   indexing starts with 0

   List support functions (inbuilt) that facilitates all the necassary operations
   List also offers a technique called slicing to read a slice(group) of elements from the list

   Duplications are allowed

   Tuple

     it is also a linear collection of objects
     supports all the read operations of array from index based reading to slicing
     but is an immutable collection(does not support manipulation - no write operations)
     Duplications are allowed

     tuple=(1,0,1,1,0)

   Set
      it is also of collection of objects
      but unordered collection of objects(no indexing)
      It holds only unique elements(duplication not allowed)
      It is immutable
      it supports function to insert and remove but not based on index
      Moreover it supports set operations like union, intersect ,minus

Operator overloading is supported in python

Operator overloading - same operator based on the context might
work differently

Dictionary
---------------

  So Dictionary is a key value pair
  it is best suitable for holding values in the form of key values 
  it is best suitable to convert json form to object form
  it is mutable
  keys must be unique
  values can have duplicates
