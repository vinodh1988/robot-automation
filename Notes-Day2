List

   it is collecton of objects
   It is a linear collection of objects
   it is a mutable collection ( the object is manipulatable)
   it supports random access(random deletion, insertion and read)
   We use indexing to access the elements
   indexing starts with 0

   List support functions (inbuilt) that facilitates all the necassary operations
   List also offers a technique called slicing to read a slice(group) of elements from the list

   Tuple

     it is also a linear collection of objects
     supports all the read operations of array from index based reading to slicing
     but is an immutable collection(does not support manipulation - no write operations)
