if a function returns a value after returning something, it cannot proceed further

a function cannot return value to the caller multiple times


filter

       Filter usually receives a collection, on 
       every element in the collection it  applies a boolean
       logic if the result is true it will keep the element
       other wise truncate

        for x number of inputs, the output length would be <=x

map
       
       map usually receives a collection , on
       every element in the collection applies a transformation
       operation  and for each element a new result would
       be produced

       for x number of inputs, always the output length would be x
