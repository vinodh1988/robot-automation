In python project

if you install a pip package using pip install
by default it goes into global library location

it can be used in all projects within that system

but we move the project to different system,
identifying the dependencies and reinstalling all of them
might become bit tedious

We go for an idea called Virtual Environment in python
world to handle this issue
